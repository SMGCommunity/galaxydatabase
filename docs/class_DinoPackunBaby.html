			<h1>Class: DinoPackunBaby</h1>
			<p>A Piranha Plant boss that resides inside its small egg before the battle starts. The player has to destroy its egg shell to reveal its large weak point. It can be damaged using Ground Pounds and Spin Attacks. Ground Pounding the shell from above will remove the entire shell at once. When its shell has been removed, it will run around in panic. The player has to repeat this procedure again to defeat it. It always damages the player upon contact. It will always spawn a Power Star when defeated. This requires a change to the galaxy's Scenario file.</p>
