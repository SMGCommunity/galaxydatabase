    "Notes": "Any object and its paths that are placed inside this area are projected around the origin of the zone. Only a limited amount of objects can be projected, objects that extend the classes MercatorFixParts, MercatorRailMoveParts and MercatorRotateParts are known to work with this. Note that the object OceanSmallTurtle requires mercator projection. This object is useless in SMG2. This object ignores the AreaShapeNo setting.",
