    "Notes": "A colorful flat block (resembles Mario Kart item boxes) that slides around on the ground. Only seen on a single planet in Gold Leaf Galaxy.\n\nExtra notes: They also have an Ice model used for an unused SMG1 Ice Flower ability, where if Ice Mario spins near an Octogoomba (possibly other enemies, untested) the enemy will be \"frozen\" into a fully functional SpinningBox using it's Ice model. This unused Ice Flower ability is extremely buggy and unpredictable, do not try to use it in your galaxies.",
