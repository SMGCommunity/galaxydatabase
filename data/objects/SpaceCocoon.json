    "Notes": "A weird spiderweb-like object which Mario and certain NPCs (Toads) can attach to and then be launched in a straight line by pulling it with the star pointer holding A in the opposite direction of the desired launch and then releasing A. How far back you pull it also affects the speed and distance of the launch. There is no way to detach yourself or an NPC to it other than launching.\n\nExtra Notes: If you are setting up a Tarantox battle, do not use this object, but it's special variant for Tarantox called SpiderAttachPoint.",
