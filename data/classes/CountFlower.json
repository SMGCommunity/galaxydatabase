The individual plant objects have to be assigned to this object by setting their GeneratorId to this object's l_id. If the object is called CountFlowerPowerStar, it can also spawn a Power Star once all plants have appeared and its SW_B got activated. This requires edits to the galaxy's Scenario file.",
