    "Notes": "An unfinished crystal cage intended for tube slides. It also loads the StarPieceDummy model as well as a Break model, however, the latter never appears. The model files are missing, though. It is clearly unfinished, seeing that it doesn't emit particles or sound effects either. When touched, the player receives eight Star Bits.",
