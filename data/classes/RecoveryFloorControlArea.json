    "Notes": "Normally, when the player falls into a PullBackArea, they won't be returned to the last position on Ice or GlassIce collision. Instead, the game treats several other collision types as safe rescuing positions. However, this area ignores the check for these two collision types so that these collision triangles are treated as proper rescuing positions.",
