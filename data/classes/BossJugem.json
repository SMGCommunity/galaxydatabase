    "InternalName": "BossJugem",
    "Notes": "A large variant of a Lakitu who wears glasses and rides on a purple cloud. He throws Spinies at the player and may also use thunderbolts to attack them. When he throws Spinies, he will be moving on a path whereas he moves between two separate points when using the thunderbolt attack. He can be damaged by thrown Shells or Yoshi projectiles. After dealing three hits, he will spawn a Power Star. This requires an edit to the galaxy's Scenario file.\nThis object also uses several GeneralPos. ジュゲム突進点１ and ジュゲム突進点２ are used as the right and left points that it moves between when using the thunderbolt attack. カメラ基準点 is used as the orientation point that the camera will look at most of the time. ボスジュゲムデモ位置 defines the position of the intro cutscene. ボスジュゲムダウンデモ位置 defines the position of the defeated cutscene.",
