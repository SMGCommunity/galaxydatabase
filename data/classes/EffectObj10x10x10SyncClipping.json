    "Notes": "A generic particles effect with a clipping radius of 1000 and a far clipping distance of 50.  Furthermore, its clipping center is at (0, 580, 0). The actual particle emitting is also dependent on the object's clipping. The particle data needs to be specified in AutoEffectList. The UniqueName also matches the object's name. It can also use sound effects. EffectEmitStart specifies the sound effect used when it starts functioning. EffectEmitting specifies the looping sound effect that is played while particles are emitting.",
