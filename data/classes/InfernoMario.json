    "Notes": "An unused and unfinished variant of a Cosmic Clone that crashes the game due to a missing model. It appears to be passive, but it will turn towards the player if they are close enough and teleport behind them. Then, it will chase after the player and mimic all of their movements like normal Cosmic Clones do. However, it can be defeated using most of the player's attacks as well as some enemy attacks.",
