    "Notes": "A controller that sets up a separate cast of cutscene objects for use with a superordinate cutscene. This is used to connect a cutscene that is spread across zones. TimeSheetName refers to the set of cutscene config files to be used and DemoName is the proper identifier name for the cutscene. DemoName should match the cutscene's identifier that it belongs to. The actual setup specifications for the individual sheet files will be included on the Luma's Workshop Wiki. Individual objects can be registered by setting their DemoGroupId to this object's l_id.",
