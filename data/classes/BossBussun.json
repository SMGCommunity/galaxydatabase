    "Notes": "A dinosaur-like boss that sleeps until Mario Ground Pounds the weak spot on her belly. Excluding the first time, the player has to damage her three times. Starting the second phase, she will shoot fire balls that can temporarily cover manhole grates in lava. During the last phase, she will turn red and move faster. She is supposed to be placed on a disk-like planet as she can freely walk around such planets and change sides. She uses two GeneralPos. ボスブッスン位置 is used as her position after the battle. マリオ位置 is used to position Mario after the battle. She always spawns a Power Star which needs to be set up in the galaxy's Scenario file.",
