    "Notes": "One of the game's main collectibles. There are two variants: Coins (Coin) and Purple Coins (PurpleCoin). Normal Coins can restore one health point if collected by the player. Purple Coins do not restore health, though. Purple Coins can only be used in Purple Comet scenarios or appropriately configured Scenario files. Normal Coins won't appear during Daredevil (Dark) Comets. Both variants can be collected by the Orange Luma in SMG2. If they are stored inside a bubble, they will also restore the player's air when underwater. Coins will spin slower when placed underwater.",
