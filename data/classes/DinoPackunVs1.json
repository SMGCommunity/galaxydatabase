    "Notes": "A large Piranha Plant boss. Before the battle, it remains inside its shell. In order to defeat it, the player has to fling its tail ball with a Spin Attack four times. It always damages the player upon contact. However, the large tail ball does not hurt the player. In SMG1, it will always spawn a Power Star when defeated, which requires a properly configured Scenario entry.",
