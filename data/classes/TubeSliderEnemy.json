    "Notes": "A Spiny variant for tube slide sections. Unlike its normal counterparts, it cannot be defeated or eaten by Yoshi, however, it can be frozen by the Orange Luma. It will start to walk when its SW_A gets activated. After walking for 10 seconds, it will disappear. It needs to be linked to a proper TubeSlider instance using GeneratorId.",
