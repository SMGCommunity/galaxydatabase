Its body disassembles when stomped, Ground Pounded, attacked with a Spin Attack or a fireball. However, it will be defeated when the player is using the Rainbow power-up, the Spin Drill or Yoshi's projectiles. Furthermore, it will sink down when touching SinkDown collision or lava collision (SMG2 only). It can be frozen by the Orange Luma.",
