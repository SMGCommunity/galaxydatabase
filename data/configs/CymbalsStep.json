    "Notes": "A set of cymbal platforms with separate collision meshes. The top one can be moved like a seesaw platform. A SW_A can be activated by Ground Pounding the top. It also supports BCK, BTK, BTP, BRK and BVA animations. Animations must have the same name as the model in order to be played. The animations will start playing once the object loads. Also supports color change (ColorChange.brk) and texture change (TexChange.btk/.btp) animations as well as shadows (Shadow.bcsv).",
