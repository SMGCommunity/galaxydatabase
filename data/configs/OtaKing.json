    "Notes": "A large octopus boss that resides in a large lava pool. In order to defeat it, the player has to fling its coconuts back against him. It shoots either three fireballs or a coconut. After the first phase, it will start to spawn Blue Podoboos. In SMG1, it will always spawn a Power Star when defeated, which requires a properly configured Scenario entry. There's also a \"Spicy\" variant which requires a few more hits. This variant does not spawn the long tentacles, though. If added and used in SMG2, it will crash the game when skipping the intro cutscene as the code does not account for the missing tentacles.",
