    "Notes": "A generic planet with a model and optional collision intended to be used for Bowser battle setups. It automatically registers to the accessor of Bowser battle setup objects. Initially, the object is not visible. The normal collision mesh has the same name as the object itself. However, it also supports WaterSurface and MoveLimit collision meshes. If the model has a joint named Move, the collision will be set to follow that joint. Furthermore, it can also use particle effects and sounds. Planets support optional Water, Indirect, Bloom, Low and Middle models as well as fur maps.",
