    "Notes": "A large variant of a Lakitu who wears glasses and rides on a purple cloud. He throws Spinies at the player and may also use thunderbolts to attack them. When he throws Spinies, he will be moving on a path whereas he moves between two separate points when using the thunderbolt attack. He can be damaged by thrown Shells or Yoshi projectiles. After dealing three hits, he will spawn a Power Star. This requires an edit to the galaxy's Scenario file.",
