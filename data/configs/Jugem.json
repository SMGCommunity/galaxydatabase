    "Notes": "An enemy that rides a cloud. It moves to the path point that the player is closest to. It throws a Spiny when the player is nearby. The Spiny can be eaten and shot by Yoshi. If the Spiny has been killed, it will throw another one. It can be defeated using most of the player's attacks and it can be eaten by Yoshi. However, it will respawn after a while. At least one Spiny should be linked to it, otherwise it won't throw any Spiny.",
