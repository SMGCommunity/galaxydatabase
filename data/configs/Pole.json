    "Notes": "A climbable pole. Pole and PoleNoModel can be climbed from all variants and the player can also climb the top part. PoleSquare and PoleSquareNoModel can be climbed from four directions and the top cannot be reached. In SMG2, Pole2Way was added which can be climbed from two directions only, so it's intended to be used in 2D-restricted sections. In SMG1, there's also code for an unfinished variant called TreeCube, but that one crashes due to missing collision. If placed in TwisterTowerGalaxy, the player will be properly removed from the pole when they touch ground.",
