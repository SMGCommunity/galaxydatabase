    "Notes": "A spawner for meteors that will crumble once they hit collision or the player. They damage the player upon contact. However, MeteorStrikeEnvironment does not interact with the player. If the object is called MeteorStrike, the meteors will only spawn if the spawner object is out of view. If the object is called MeteorCannon, the camera will shake once a meteor crumbles. For some reason, MeteorStrikeEnvironment crashes the game if a meteor hits collision.",
