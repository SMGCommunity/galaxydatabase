    "Notes": "A generic map object with a model and collision. It starts the Bound animation when stomped or Ground Pounded. The actual bouncing needs to be specified using floor collision codes. It also supports BCK, BTK, BTP, BRK and BVA animations. Animations must have the same name as the model in order to be played. The animations will start playing once the object loads. Also supports color change (ColorChange.brk) and texture change (TexChange.btk/.btk) animations as well as shadows (Shadow.bcsv). Lastly, it also supports an optional Bloom model.",
