    "Notes": "An area that restricts the player's movement to a 2D plane while the player is inside it. The movement direction is adjusted for moving around a circular center point. Basically, this also allows the player to keep running into the direction the stick was held in first. This area may be a bit complicated to use, so it's advised to take a look at Tarantox's zone in SMG1.",
