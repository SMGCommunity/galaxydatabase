    "Notes": "A strange boss that throws large sand boulders or bombs to attack the player. Sometimes, it opens its large mouth which the player needs to attack with fireballs in order to defeat it. During the second phase, it creates two large cannons that shoot more obstacles. Once defeated, it will spawn a Power Star. However, this requires a properly configured Scenario entry. If SW_APPEAR is not used, the boss battle will start immediately.",
