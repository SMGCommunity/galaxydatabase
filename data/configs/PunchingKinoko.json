    "Notes": "A bubbly plant that the player can fling around to damage other objects and enemies. However, if it hits the player, they will loose a lot of Star Bits. It can be frozen or used by the Orange Luma as well. If placed inside a ClipDrawArea in SMG2, it will be shrunken down and unusable. When Bulb Yoshi's light surrounds the plant, it will grow back to its usable size.",
