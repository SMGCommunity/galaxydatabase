    "Notes": "A set of small blocks that start out as a normal platform and begin to move like a snake when stepped on by the player. However, if no path was assigned, it won't move at all. The total length of blocks will be (Obj_arg3 + 1) * Obj_arg2. Another RepeatBlock instance can be linked to it, which ensures that all Snake Blocks move once stepped on.",
