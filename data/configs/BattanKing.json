Like his smaller counterparts, this boss will try to fall onto the player to attack them. He can also attack using shockwaves that appear when he jumps. When he's lying on ground, the player can Ground Pound the weak spot on its back to damage him. After hitting the boss three times, he will be defeated. He always spawns a Power Star.",
