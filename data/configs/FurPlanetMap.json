    "Notes": "A generic planet with a model and optional collision that also supports fur maps. The normal collision mesh has the same name as the object itself. However, it also supports WaterSurface and MoveLimit collision meshes. If the model has a joint named Move, the collision will be set to follow that joint. Furthermore, it can also use particle effects and sounds. Planets support optional Water, Indirect, Bloom, Low and Middle models. As PlanetMap already supports fur maps in SMG2, FurPlanetMap is rather redundant in this game.",
