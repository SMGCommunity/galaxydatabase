It comes with a huge set of parameters, configurations and optional sound effects. The sound names are self-explanatory: RailMoverStop, RailMoverWaitStart, RailMoverWaitStartMove, RailMoverRestartAtEnd, RailMoverWaiting, RailMoverMoveStart, RailMoverMoveLoop, RailMoverSignStart, RailMoverSignLoop, RailMoverStopAtPoint, RailMoverStopAtPointAfter, RailMoverStopAtPointLoop, RailMoverStopAtEnd, RailMoverStopAtEndAfter, RailMoverStopAtEndLoop, RailMoverStopAtEndWithPlayerOn, RailRotatorRotateStart, and RailRotatorRotateLoop. Furthermore, it also supports the optional animations Move and RailMoveSign; the latter would be used when SignMotionType is set to a value representing the shaking behavior. Lastly, it can also use the stage effects Start, Moving, and Stop.",
