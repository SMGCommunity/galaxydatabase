    "Notes": "A bag-like enemy that wanders around while becoming fully invisible. However, it's path is indicated by the footprints it creates. If the player isn't too close, it will pause and turn visible. It will start to wander around again if the player comes closer, though. It can be defeated using Spin Attacks, Ground Pounds, stomping, fireballs, the Rainbow power-up as well as by having Yoshi eat it. It can be frozen by the second player's pointer. Once defeated, it will drop 20 Star Bits.",
