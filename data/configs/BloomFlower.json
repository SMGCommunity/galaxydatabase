    "Notes": "An unused class that does not work properly due to a programming error. Normally, it is meant to grow if it's in Bulb Yoshi's light range. This would make a Star Bit appear as well. However, the developers messed up a nerve check, so this effect is never triggered. If it's outside Bulb Yoshi's light, however, it will wither again.",
