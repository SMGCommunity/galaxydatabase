    "Notes": "A map object with a model and optional collision that usually moves on a set path and rotates when stepped on. It comes with a huge set of parameters, configurations and optional sound effects. The sound names are self-explanatory: RailMoverStop, RailMoverWaitStart, RailMoverWaitStartMove, RailMoverRestartAtEnd, RailMoverWaiting, RailMoverMoveStart, RailMoverMoveLoop, RailMoverSignStart, RailMoverSignLoop, RailMoverStopAtPoint, RailMoverStopAtPointAfter, RailMoverStopAtPointLoop, RailMoverStopAtEnd, RailMoverStopAtEndAfter, RailMoverStopAtEndLoop, and RailMoverStopAtEndWithPlayerOn. Some sound effects depend on the used rotation type. If RotateAxis is 0, the sounds are MapPartsSeesaw1AxisRotatorBound and MapPartsSeesaw1AxisRotatorMove. If RotateAxis is 1, the only sound is MapPartsRotateLoop. If RotateAxis is 2, the only sound is MapPartsSeesaw2AxisRollerRotatorMove. Furthermore, it also supports the optional animations Move and RailMoveSign; the latter would be used when SignMotionType is set to a value representing the shaking behavior. Lastly, it can also use the stage effects Start, Moving, and Stop.",
