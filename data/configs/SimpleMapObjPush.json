    "Notes": "A generic map object with a model and optional collision whose sensors push the player away. It also supports BCK, BTK, BTP, BRK and BVA animations. Animations must have the same name as the model in order to be played. The animations will start playing once the object loads. Also supports color change (ColorChange.brk) and texture change (TexChange.btk/.btp) animations as well as shadows (Shadow.bcsv). Lastly, it also supports an optional Bloom model.",
