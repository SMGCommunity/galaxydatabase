Starting the second phase, she will shoot fire balls that can temporarily cover manhole grates in lava. During the last phase, she will turn red and move faster. She is supposed to be placed on a disk-like planet as she can freely walk around such planets and change sides.\nShe always spawns a Power Star which needs to be set up in the galaxy's Scenario file.",
