    "Notes": "A bug-like enemy that remains idle until the player approaches it. If the player has the Bee power-up, it will chase after the player to damage them. Otherwise, it will flee from the player before dropping on its back after a while. This can be accomplished by attacking it with most of the player's attacks as well. Attacking it again will defeat it. However, it can be instantly defeated using a Ground Pound, the Rainbow power-up and the player's fireballs. Usually, it reveals three Star Bits when defeated. However, it drops a Coin when Ground Pounded or stomped.",
