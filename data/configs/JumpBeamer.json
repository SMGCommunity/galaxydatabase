    "Notes": "A purple stationary robot enemy with a spring head. It remains in the ground passively before the player approaches it. If the player is nearby, it jumps out of the ground and emits several rings of electricity. The player can bounce off of its spring head. It gets stunned when using a Spin Attack. This fully expands its spring head. It is not possible to destroy it through any means.",
