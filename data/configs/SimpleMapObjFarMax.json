    "Notes": "A variant of SimpleMapObj. This is a generic map object with a model, collision and a maximum far clipping distance. It also supports BCK, BTK, BTP, BRK and BVA animations. Animations must have the same name as the model in order to be played. The animations will start playing once the object loads. Also supports color change (ColorChange.brk) and texture change (TexChange.btk/.btp) animations as well as shadows (Shadow.bcsv). Lastly, it also supports an optional Bloom model.",
