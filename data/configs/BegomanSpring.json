    "InternalName": "BegomanSpring",
    "Notes": "A rotating robot enemy that features a spring head which the player can bounce off. It can be defeated by smashing it against electric currents (such as ElectricRail). If it falls into water, it will be defeated as well. It gets stunned when using a Spin Attack. This fully expands its spring head. If the object is called BegomanSpringHide, it will remain in the ground until the player gets in its range. This variant will also spawn a Topmini if hit with a Spin Attack. There can only be one Topmini at a time.",
