    "Notes": "A Toad that delivers special letters, such as those that open up a new mission. The letters and their appearance conditions are defined in the game's code. Initially, it will be hidden until the player has collected 13 Power Stars. An additional Toad (Kinopio) can be linked to it using GeneratorId which will be hidden once this object is set to appear. This uses a very complex dialogue system that doesn't allow for much customization. MarioFaceShipZone provides dialogues, though.",
