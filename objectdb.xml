A fiery version of Gobblegut that appears in Battle Belt Galaxy.

-- CLASS NOTES --
A long dragon boss. It features six weak spots that have to be popped using the player's attacks. It always spawns a Power Star. It uses a GeneralPos with the name プレイヤーデモ位置（ベリードラゴン戦） to position the player during the intro. If it's part of a cutscene, it also creates cutscene objects for KoopaJr and KoopaJrPod. See BellyDragonLv1Zone for a better look inside the cutscene.</notes>

The rocky planet from Battle Belt Galaxy where Fiery Gobblegut is fought.

-- CLASS NOTES --
A generic planet with a model and optional collision. The normal collision mesh has the same name as the object itself. However, it also supports WaterSurface and MoveLimit collision meshes. If the model has a joint named Move, the collision will be set to follow that joint. Furthermore, it can also use particle effects and sounds. Any object defined in PlanetMapDataTable usually becomes a PlanetMap object, excluding some objects. Planets support optional Water, Indirect, Bloom, Low and Middle models. In SMG2, this class supports fur maps.</notes>

The boss fought at the end of the second mission of Yoshi Star Galaxy.

-- CLASS NOTES --
A large variant of a Lakitu who wears glasses and rides on a purple cloud. He throws Spinies at the player and may also use thunderbolts to attack them. When he throws Spinies, he will be moving on a path whereas he moves between two separate points when using the thunderbolt attack. He can be damaged by thrown Shells or Yoshi projectiles. After dealing three hits, he will spawn a Power Star. This requires an edit to the galaxy's Scenario file.
This object also uses several GeneralPos. ジュゲム突進点１ and ジュゲム突進点２ are used as the right and left points that it moves between when using the thunderbolt attack. カメラ基準点 is used as the orientation point that the camera will look at most of the time. ボスジュゲムデモ位置 defines the position of the intro cutscene. ボスジュゲムダウンデモ位置 defines the position of the defeated cutscene.</notes>

A large bug-like boss that can be damaged by Ground Pounding the weak spot on its back. It needs to be damaged three times. During the first phase, it moves slowly on the ground. After taking the first hit, it starts flying. And in the last phase, its skin turns red and it will make aggressive turns while it flies. While it flies, it will periodically drop explosive bombs that can hurt the player. After it is defeated, it will spawn a Power Star, which also requires changes to the galaxy's Scenario file.</notes>

A generic planet with a model and optional collision. The normal collision mesh has the same name as the object itself. However, it also supports WaterSurface and MoveLimit collision meshes. If the model has a joint named Move, the collision will be set to follow that joint. Furthermore, it can also use particle effects and sounds. Any object defined in PlanetMapDataTable usually becomes a PlanetMap object, excluding some objects. Planets support optional Water, Indirect, Bloom, Low and Middle models. In SMG2, this class supports fur maps.</notes>

Any object defined in PlanetMapDataTable usually becomes a PlanetMap object, excluding some objects. Planets support optional Water, Indirect, Bloom, Low and Middle models. In SMG2, this class supports fur maps.</notes>

A large mole boss. In SMG1, he chases a Star Bunny before the actual battle begins. He attacks the player upon contact. The player needs to damage him three times to defeat him. It also creates trails of dirt when it moves around. He is usually underground but can be stunned using a Ground Pound when his head is above the ground. This gives the player a chance to attack him. He uses several GeneralPos. マリオ再セット1 specifies the player's position after the intro cutscene, マリオ再セット specifies the player's position after hitting him and ドドリュウ再セット specifies his reset position after hitting it. In SMG1, it always spawns a Power Star and uses text for the Star Bunny it chases.</notes>

A long pillar that becomes transparent; used in Fleet Glide Galaxy.

-- CLASS NOTES --
A generic map object that will turn invisible if the camera passes it. For this, it loads a separate model with the suffix Alpha. The Alpha model uses two animations. Normal.brk, which is used for the visible state, and Alpha.brk, which is used to make the model fade out of existence.
It also supports BCK, BTK, BTP, BRK and BVA animations. Animations must have the same name as the model in order to be played. The animations will start playing once the object loads. Also supports color change (ColorChange.brk) and texture change (TexChange.btk/.btk) animations as well as shadows (Shadow.bcsv). Lastly, it also supports an optional Bloom model.</notes>

An object with a model and collision that can be Ground Pounded to move it away from its initial position. The distance, required Ground Pounds and more can be configured. Initially, the object can only be Ground Pounded from the bottom side of the model to move it upwards. It can play various different sounds: Start, Moving, StopEnd and Stop, all of which are self-explanatory. Interestingly, the class offers an unused functionality where one or more buttons (HipDropMoveBlockSwitch) can be attached to the object that will cause the object to move when one of the buttons has been stomped. The positions and offsets can be defined in a file called InitHipDropMoveBlockSwitch.bcsv. The actual model for the button actor does not exist anymore and needs to be restored. Unfortunately, the button does not take the object's rotation into account when placed.</notes>

A square-shaped Ground Pound block used on the first planet of Puzzle Plank Galaxy.

-- CLASS NOTES --
An object with a model and collision that can be Ground Pounded to move it away from its initial position. The distance, required Ground Pounds and more can be configured. Initially, the object can only be Ground Pounded from the bottom side of the model to move it upwards. It can play various different sounds: Start, Moving, StopEnd and Stop, all of which are self-explanatory. Interestingly, the class offers an unused functionality where one or more buttons (HipDropMoveBlockSwitch) can be attached to the object that will cause the object to move when one of the buttons has been stomped. The positions and offsets can be defined in a file called InitHipDropMoveBlockSwitch.bcsv. The actual model for the button actor does not exist anymore and needs to be restored. Unfortunately, the button does not take the object's rotation into account when placed.</notes>

A generic planet with a model and optional collision. The normal collision mesh has the same name as the object itself. However, it also supports WaterSurface and MoveLimit collision meshes. If the model has a joint named Move, the collision will be set to follow that joint. Furthermore, it can also use particle effects and sounds. Any object defined in PlanetMapDataTable usually becomes a PlanetMap object, excluding some objects. Planets support optional Water, Indirect, Bloom, Low and Middle models. In SMG2, this class supports fur maps.</notes>

-- CLASS NOTES --
A bug-like enemy that remains idle until the player approaches it. If the player has the Bee power-up, it will chase after the player to damage them. Otherwise, it will flee from the player before dropping on its back after a while. This can be accomplished by attacking it with most of the player's attacks as well. Attacking it again will defeat it. However, it can be instantly defeated using a Ground Pound, the Rainbow power-up and the player's fireballs. Usually, it reveals three Star Bits when defeated. However, it drops a Coin when Ground Pounded or stomped.</notes>

Any object defined in PlanetMapDataTable usually becomes a PlanetMap object, excluding some objects. Planets support optional Water, Indirect, Bloom, Low and Middle models. In SMG2, this class supports fur maps.</notes>

If the model has a joint named Move, the collision will be set to follow that joint. Furthermore, it can also use particle effects and sounds. Any object defined in PlanetMapDataTable usually becomes a PlanetMap object, excluding some objects. Planets support optional Water, Indirect, Bloom, Low and Middle models. In SMG2, this class supports fur maps.</notes>

One of the game's main collectibles. There are two variants: Coins (Coin) and Purple Coins (PurpleCoin). Normal Coins can restore one health point if collected by the player. Purple Coins do not restore health, though. Purple Coins can only be used in Purple Comet scenarios or appropriately configured Scenario files. Normal Coins won't appear during Daredevil (Dark) Comets. Both variants can be collected by the Orange Luma in SMG2. If they are stored inside a bubble, they will also restore the player's air when underwater. Coins will spin slower when placed underwater.</notes>

Normally, when the player falls into a PullBackArea, they won't be returned to the last position on Ice or GlassIce collision. Instead, the game treats several other collision types as safe rescuing positions. However, this area ignores the check for these two collision types so that these collision triangles are treated as proper rescuing positions.</notes>

The large star-shaped planet.

-- CLASS NOTES --
A generic planet with a model and optional collision. The normal collision mesh has the same name as the object itself. However, it also supports WaterSurface and MoveLimit collision meshes. If the model has a joint named Move, the collision will be set to follow that joint. Furthermore, it can also use particle effects and sounds. Any object defined in PlanetMapDataTable usually becomes a PlanetMap object, excluding some objects. Planets support optional Water, Indirect, Bloom, Low and Middle models. In SMG2, this class supports fur maps.</notes>

A generic planet with a model and optional collision. The normal collision mesh has the same name as the object itself. However, it also supports WaterSurface and MoveLimit collision meshes. If the model has a joint named Move, the collision will be set to follow that joint. Furthermore, it can also use particle effects and sounds. Any object defined in PlanetMapDataTable usually becomes a PlanetMap object, excluding some objects. Planets support optional Water, Indirect, Bloom, Low and Middle models. In SMG2, this class supports fur maps.</notes>

The cylindrical tree planet from Tall Trunk Galaxy.

-- CLASS NOTES --
A generic planet with a model and optional collision. The normal collision mesh has the same name as the object itself. However, it also supports WaterSurface and MoveLimit collision meshes. If the model has a joint named Move, the collision will be set to follow that joint. Furthermore, it can also use particle effects and sounds. Any object defined in PlanetMapDataTable usually becomes a PlanetMap object, excluding some objects. Planets support optional Water, Indirect, Bloom, Low and Middle models. In SMG2, this class supports fur maps.</notes>

Any object defined in PlanetMapDataTable usually becomes a PlanetMap object, excluding some objects. Planets support optional Water, Indirect, Bloom, Low and Middle models. In SMG2, this class supports fur maps.</notes>
